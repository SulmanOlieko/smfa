# Stochastic metafrontier estimation

`smfa` estimates a stochastic metafrontier model for cross-sectional or
pooled data. The function follows the theoretical frameworks of Battese,
Rao, and O'Donnell (2004) and O'Donnell, Rao, and Battese (2008), and
additionally implements the two-stage stochastic approach of Huang,
Huang, and Liu (2014). Three types of group-level frontier models are
supported: standard stochastic frontier analysis
([`sfacross`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/sfaR/man/sfacross.html)), sample
selection stochastic frontier analysis
([`sfaselectioncross`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/sfaR/man/sfaselectioncross.html)),
and latent class stochastic frontier analysis
([`sfalcmcross`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/sfaR/man/sfalcmcross.html)).

## Arguments

- formula:

  A symbolic description of the frontier model to be estimated, based on
  the generic function
  [`formula`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/formula.html). For
  `groupType = "sfaselectioncross"`, this argument specifies the
  frontier (outcome) equation and must be a standard formula whose
  left-hand side is the output (or cost) variable and whose right-hand
  side contains the frontier regressors (see also `selectionF`).

- muhet:

  A one-part formula to account for heterogeneity in the mean of the
  pre-truncated normal distribution. Applicable only when
  `groupType = "sfacross"` and `udist = "tnormal"`. The variables
  specified model the conditional mean \\\mu_i =
  \bm{\omega}'\mathbf{Z}\_{\mu}\\ of the truncated normal inefficiency
  distribution (see section ‘Details’).

- uhet:

  A one-part formula to account for heteroscedasticity in the one-sided
  error variance. Applicable for all three model types. The variance of
  the inefficiency term is modelled as \\\sigma^2_u =
  \exp(\bm{\delta}'\mathbf{Z}\_u)\\, where \\\mathbf{Z}\_u\\ are the
  inefficiency drivers and \\\bm{\delta}\\ the associated coefficients
  (see section ‘Details’).

- vhet:

  A one-part formula to account for heteroscedasticity in the two-sided
  error variance. Applicable for all three model types. The variance of
  the noise term is modelled as \\\sigma^2_v =
  \exp(\bm{\phi}'\mathbf{Z}\_v)\\, where \\\mathbf{Z}\_v\\ are the
  heteroscedasticity variables and \\\bm{\phi}\\ the coefficients (see
  section ‘Details’).

- thet:

  A one-part formula to account for technological heterogeneity in the
  construction of the latent classes. Applicable only when
  `groupType = "sfalcmcross"`. The variables specified enter the logit
  formulation that determines the prior class membership probabilities
  \\\pi(i,j)\\ (see section ‘Details’).

- logDepVar:

  Logical. Informs whether the dependent variable is logged (`TRUE`) or
  not (`FALSE`). Default `TRUE`. Must match the transformation applied
  to the left-hand side of `formula`.

- data:

  A data frame containing all variables referenced in `formula`,
  `selectionF`, `muhet`, `uhet`, `vhet`, `thet`, and `group`.

- subset:

  An optional vector specifying a subset of observations to be used in
  the estimation process.

- weights:

  An optional vector of weights to be used for weighted log-likelihood
  estimation. Should be `NULL` or a numeric vector with strictly
  positive values. When `NULL` (default), all observations receive equal
  weight.

- wscale:

  Logical. When `weights` is not `NULL`, a scaling transformation is
  applied such that the weights sum to the sample size:
  \$\$w\_{\mathrm{new}} = n \times \frac{w\_{\mathrm{old}}}{\sum
  w\_{\mathrm{old}}}\$\$ Default `TRUE`. When `FALSE`, the raw weights
  are used without scaling.

- group:

  Character string. The name of the column in `data` identifying the
  technology group of each observation. The column is coerced to a
  factor internally and must have at least two unique values. When
  `groupType = "sfalcmcross"` and `group` is `NULL`, a single pooled
  latent class model is estimated and class assignments serve as groups
  (see section ‘Details’).

- S:

  Integer. Frontier orientation.

  - `S = 1` (default): production or profit frontier, \\\varepsilon_i =
    v_i - u_i\\.

  - `S = -1`: cost frontier, \\\varepsilon_i = v_i + u_i\\.

- udist:

  Character string. Distribution for the one-sided error term \\u_i \ge
  0\\. The following distributions are available for
  `groupType = "sfacross"`:

  - `"hnormal"` (default): half-normal distribution (Aigner *et al.*,
    1977; Meeusen and van den Broeck, 1977).

  - `"exponential"`: exponential distribution.

  - `"tnormal"`: truncated normal distribution (Stevenson, 1980).

  - `"rayleigh"`: Rayleigh distribution (Hajargasht, 2015).

  - `"uniform"`: uniform distribution (Li, 1996; Nguyen, 2010).

  - `"gamma"`: Gamma distribution, estimated by maximum simulated
    likelihood (Greene, 2003).

  - `"lognormal"`: log-normal distribution, estimated by maximum
    simulated likelihood (Migon and Medici, 2001; Wang and Ye, 2020).

  - `"weibull"`: Weibull distribution, estimated by maximum simulated
    likelihood (Tsionas, 2007).

  - `"genexponential"`: generalised exponential distribution
    (Papadopoulos, 2020).

  - `"tslaplace"`: truncated skewed Laplace distribution (Wang, 2012).

  For `groupType = "sfaselectioncross"` and `"sfalcmcross"`, only
  `"hnormal"` is currently supported.

- start:

  Numeric vector. Optional starting values for the maximum
  likelihood (ML) or maximum simulated likelihood (MSL) estimation of
  the group-level frontier models. When `NULL` (default), starting
  values are computed automatically. For `groupType = "sfacross"`, they
  are derived from OLS residuals. For `groupType = "sfalcmcross"`, they
  depend on `whichStart`.

- scaling:

  Logical. Applicable only when `groupType = "sfacross"` and
  `udist = "tnormal"`. When `TRUE`, the scaling property model (Wang and
  Schmidt, 2002) is estimated, whereby \\u_i = h(\mathbf{Z}\_u,
  \bm{\delta}) u^\*\_i\\ and \\u^\*\_i\\ follows a truncated normal
  distribution \\N^+(\tau, \exp(c_u))\\. Default `FALSE`.

- modelType:

  Character string. Applicable only when
  `groupType = "sfaselectioncross"`. Specifies the model used to correct
  for selection bias. Currently, only `"greene10"` (default) is
  supported, corresponding to the two-step approach of Greene (2010): a
  probit model is estimated for the selection equation, and its inverse
  Mills ratio is included as a correction term in the stochastic
  frontier second step.

- groupType:

  Character string. Type of frontier model estimated for each technology
  group. Three options are available:

  - `"sfacross"` (default): standard cross-sectional stochastic frontier
    analysis ([`sfacross`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/sfaR/man/sfacross.html)).
    Groups are defined by the `group` variable. All 10 distributions for
    `udist` are supported, along with heteroscedasticity in both error
    components (`uhet`, `vhet`), heterogeneity in the truncated mean
    (`muhet`), and the scaling property.

  - `"sfaselectioncross"`: sample selection stochastic frontier analysis
    ([`sfaselectioncross`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/sfaR/man/sfaselectioncross.html)).
    Corrects for sample selection bias via the generalised Heckman
    approach (Greene, 2010). Requires `selectionF`. Only observations
    for which the selection indicator equals one enter the frontier and
    metafrontier; efficiency estimates for non-selected observations are
    `NA`. Only `udist = "hnormal"` is supported.

  - `"sfalcmcross"`: latent class stochastic frontier analysis
    ([`sfalcmcross`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/sfaR/man/sfalcmcross.html)).
    Estimates a finite mixture of frontier models with the number of
    classes determined by `lcmClasses`. When `group` is supplied, a
    separate latent class model is estimated per group-stratum and
    combined for the metafrontier. When `group` is omitted, a single
    pooled model is estimated and class assignments serve as technology
    groups. Supports `thet` for class-membership covariates and `uhet`,
    `vhet` for within-class heteroscedasticity. Only `udist = "hnormal"`
    is supported.

- metaMethod:

  Character string. Method for estimating the global metafrontier that
  envelopes all group frontiers. Three options are available:

  - `"lp"` (default): deterministic linear programming envelope. Finds
    the parameter vector \\\bm{\beta}^\*\\ minimising \\\sum_i \|\ln
    \hat{f}(x_i, \bm{\beta}^\*) - \ln \hat{f}(x_i,
    \hat{\bm{\beta}}\_{(g)})\|\\ subject to \\\ln \hat{f}(x_i,
    \bm{\beta}^\*) \ge \ln \hat{f}(x_i, \hat{\bm{\beta}}\_{(g)})\\ for
    all observations and all groups (Battese *et al.*, 2004).

  - `"qp"`: deterministic quadratic programming envelope. Minimises the
    sum of squared deviations under the same envelope constraint.

  - `"sfa"`: stochastic metafrontier estimated by a second-stage pooled
    SFA. The specific construction of the dependent variable is
    determined by `sfaApproach`.

- sfaApproach:

  Character string. Applicable only when `metaMethod = "sfa"`.
  Determines how the second-stage SFA is constructed:

  - `"ordonnell"` (default): The LP envelope of the group frontier
    predicted values is re-estimated with a stochastic frontier,
    following O'Donnell, Rao, and Battese (2008). The second-stage SFA
    directly targets the global technology envelope.

  - `"huang"`: the group-specific fitted frontier value \\\ln
    \hat{y}^g_i\\ for each observation is used as the dependent variable
    in a pooled cross-sectional SFA (Huang, Huang, and Liu, 2014). The
    technology gap \\U_i \ge 0\\ and second-stage noise \\V_i\\ are
    estimated directly by the SFA procedure.

  - `"ordonnell"`: the column-wise maximum of all group-fitted frontier
    values (the deterministic LP envelope) is used as the dependent
    variable in the second-stage SFA (O'Donnell, Rao, and Battese,
    2008).

- selectionF:

  A two-sided formula specifying the sample selection equation, e.g.,
  `selected ~ z1 + z2`. The left-hand side must be a binary (0/1)
  indicator already present in `data`: `1` means the observation
  participates in the frontier and metafrontier; `0` means it is
  excluded (efficiency estimates will be `NA`). Alternatively, a named
  list of formulas, one per group level, may be supplied to allow
  group-specific selection equations. Required when
  `groupType = "sfaselectioncross"`; ignored otherwise.

- lcmClasses:

  Integer. Number of latent classes to be estimated per group when
  `groupType = "sfalcmcross"`. Must be between `2` and `5` (default
  `2`). The optimal number of classes can be selected based on
  information criteria (see
  [`ic`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/sfaR/man/ic.html)).

- whichStart:

  Integer. Strategy for obtaining starting values in the latent class
  model (`groupType = "sfalcmcross"`):

  - `1`: starting values are obtained from the method of moments.

  - `2` (default): the model is initialised by first solving a
    homoscedastic pooled cross-sectional SFA using the algorithm
    specified by `initAlg` for at most `initIter` iterations.

- initAlg:

- initIter:

  Integer. Maximum number of iterations for the initialisation algorithm
  when `whichStart = 2` and `groupType = "sfalcmcross"`. Default `100`.

- lType:

  Character string. Specifies how the likelihood is evaluated for the
  selection model (`groupType = "sfaselectioncross"`). Five options are

  - `"pcubature"`: p-adaptive cubature (see
    [`pcubature`](https://bnaras.github.io/cubature/reference/hcubature.html)).

  - `"msl"`: maximum simulated likelihood (controlled by `simType`,
    `Nsim`, `prime`, `burn`, `antithetics`, and `seed`).

- Nsub:

  Integer. Number of quadrature nodes or integration subdivisions when

  Applicable only when `groupType = "sfaselectioncross"`. Default `100`.

- uBound:

  Numeric. Upper bound for the numerical integration of the inefficiency
  component when `lType` is `"kronrod"`, `"hcubature"`, or
  `"pcubature"`. For Gauss-Hermite the bound is automatically infinite.
  Applicable only when `groupType = "sfaselectioncross"`. Default `Inf`.

- intol:

  Numeric. Integration tolerance for the quadrature approaches
  `"kronrod"`, `"hcubature"`, and `"pcubature"`. Applicable only when
  `groupType = "sfaselectioncross"`. Default `1e-6`.

  estimation of each group-level frontier model. Default `"bfgs"`.
  Eleven algorithms are available:

    [`maxBFGS`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/maxLik/man/maxBFGS.html)).

  - `"bhhh"`: Berndt-Hall-Hall-Hausman (see
    [`maxBHHH`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/maxLik/man/maxNR.html)).

  - `"nm"`: Nelder-Mead (see
    [`maxNM`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/maxLik/man/maxBFGS.html)).

- hessianType:

  Integer. Specifies which Hessian is returned for the group-level
  frontier estimation. The accepted values match those of the underlying
  `sfaR` function for each `groupType`:

  - For `groupType = "sfacross"`: if `1` (default), the analytic Hessian
    is returned; if `2`, the BHHH Hessian \\\mathbf{G}'\mathbf{G}\\ is
    estimated.

  - For `groupType = "sfalcmcross"`: if `1` (default), the analytic

  standard errors computed by `smfa` are identical to those from a
  standalone `sfaR` call on the same group subset.

  Integer. Random seed for simulation draws, ensuring reproducibility of
  MSL estimates. Default `12345`.

  of each group-level model. Default `FALSE`.

  Numeric. Convergence tolerance. The algorithm is considered converged
  when the change in the log-likelihood between successive iterations is
  smaller than `tol` in absolute value. Default `1e-12`.

- gradtol:

  Numeric. Gradient convergence tolerance. The algorithm is considered
  converged when the Euclidean norm of the gradient is smaller than
  `gradtol`. Default `1e-6`.

- stepmax:

  Numeric. Maximum step length used by the `"ucminf"` algorithm. Default
  `0.1`.

- qac:

  Character string. Quadratic Approximation Correction for the `"bhhh"`
  and `"nr"` algorithms when the Hessian is not negative definite:

  - `"marquardt"` (default): step length is decreased while also
    shifting closer to the gradient direction.

  - `"stephalving"`: step length is halved, preserving the current
    direction.

  See [`maxBHHH`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/maxLik/man/maxNR.html) and
  [`maxNR`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/maxLik/man/maxNR.html) for details.

## Details

### Standard stochastic frontier (`groupType = "sfacross"`)

The stochastic frontier model is defined as: \$\$y_i = \alpha +
\mathbf{x}\_i'\bm{\beta} + v_i - Su_i\$\$ where \\y\\ is the output
(cost, revenue, or profit), \\\mathbf{x}\\ is the vector of frontier
regressors, \\u_i \ge 0\\ is the one-sided inefficiency term with
variance \\\sigma^2_u\\, and \\v_i\\ is the symmetric noise term with
variance \\\sigma^2_v\\.

Estimation is by ML for all distributions except `"gamma"`,
`"lognormal"`, and `"weibull"`, for which MSL is used with Halton,
Generalised-Halton, Sobol, or uniform draws. Antithetic draws are
available for the uniform case.

To account for heteroscedasticity, the variances are modelled as
\\\sigma^2_u = \exp(\bm{\delta}'\mathbf{Z}\_u)\\ and \\\sigma^2_v =
\exp(\bm{\phi}'\mathbf{Z}\_v)\\. For the truncated normal distribution,
heterogeneity in the pre-truncation mean is modelled as \\\mu_i =
\bm{\omega}'\mathbf{Z}\_{\mu}\\. The scaling property (Wang and Schmidt,
2002) can also be imposed for the truncated normal.

### Sample selection frontier (`groupType = "sfaselectioncross"`)

This model extends the Heckman (1979) selection framework to the
stochastic frontier setting (Greene, 2010; Dakpo *et al.*, 2021). The
selection and frontier equations are: \$\$y\_{1i}^\* =
\mathbf{Z}\_{si}'\bm{\gamma} + w_i, \quad w_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)\$\$
\$\$y\_{2i}^\* = \mathbf{x}\_i'\bm{\beta} + v_i - Su_i\$\$ where
\\y\_{1i} = \mathbf{1}(y\_{1i}^\* \> 0)\\ is the binary selection
indicator and \\y\_{2i} = y\_{2i}^\*\\ is observed only when \\y\_{1i} =
1\\. Selection bias arises from \\\rho = \mathrm{Corr}(w_i, v_i) \ne
0\\. Only selected observations enter the frontier and metafrontier
estimation; efficiency estimates for non-selected observations are `NA`.

### Latent class frontier (`groupType = "sfalcmcross"`)

The latent class model (Orea and Kumbhakar, 2004) estimates a finite
mixture of \\J\\ frontier models: \$\$y_i = \alpha_j +
\mathbf{x}\_i'\bm{\beta}\_j + v\_{i\|j} - Su\_{i\|j}\$\$ The prior class
probability follows a logit specification: \$\$\pi(i,j) =
\frac{\exp(\bm{\theta}\_j'\mathbf{Z}\_{hi})}
{\sum\_{m=1}^{J}\exp(\bm{\theta}\_m'\mathbf{Z}\_{hi})}\$\$ Class
assignment is based on the maximum posterior probability computed via
Bayes' rule. When `group` is omitted, a single pooled model is estimated
and class assignments serve as technology groups.

### Metafrontier estimation

The global metafrontier \\f(x_i, \bm{\beta}^\*)\\ envelopes all group
frontiers. With LP (Battese *et al.*, 2004), \\\bm{\beta}^\*\\ minimises
\\\sum_i \|\ln \hat{f}(x_i, \bm{\beta}^\*) - \ln \hat{f}(x_i,
\hat{\bm{\beta}}\_{(g)})\|\\ subject to \\\ln \hat{f}(x_i,
\bm{\beta}^\*) \ge \ln \hat{f}(x_i, \hat{\bm{\beta}}\_{(g)})\\. QP
minimises the squared analogue. The stochastic approaches (Huang *et
al.*, 2014; O'Donnell *et al.*, 2008) treat the technology gap \\U_i\\
as a one-sided error in a second-stage SFA. Group and metafrontier
efficiencies are: \$\$TE_i^g = \exp(-u_i^g), \quad MTR_i = \exp(-U_i),
\quad TE_i^\* = TE_i^g \times MTR_i\$\$ Both Jondrow *et al.* (1982) and
Battese and Coelli (1988) estimators are provided for each measure. See
[`efficiencies`](https://SulmanOlieko.github.io/smfa/reference/efficiencies.md)
for details.

#> Warning: 344 MTR value(s) > 1 detected in O'Donnell SFA approach. This typically occurs when the second-stage SFA estimates near-zero inefficiency (sigma_u -> 0), causing TE_meta ~= 1 and MTR = TE_meta/TE_group > 1. Consider using metaMethod='lp' or sfaApproach='huang' instead.
