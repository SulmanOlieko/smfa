# Latent Class SFA Metafrontier (groupType = "sfalcmcross")

## Overview

In many applications, the technology groups that firms belong to are
**unobserved** — we cannot directly observe which firms operate under
which technology type. The latent class model (LCM) addresses this by:

1.  Fitting a **pooled latent class SFA** on the entire dataset,
    simultaneously estimating class-specific frontier parameters and
    class membership probabilities for each firm.
2.  Assigning each firm to a class based on its highest **posterior
    class probability**.
3.  Using these assignments as the technology groups for the
    metafrontier.

This approach is appropriate when: - No observed group variable is
available. - Technology heterogeneity is suspected but not directly
measurable. - A priori group boundaries are unclear or arbitrary.

## Data Preparation

We use the `utility` dataset from `sfaR`, which contains 791
observations from US electricity utilities. We estimate a cost frontier
with no explicit group variable.

``` r
library(metafrontieR)
data("utility", package = "sfaR")
```

## Method 1: LCM + LP Metafrontier

Fit a 2-class latent class pooled SFA, then estimate the LP
deterministic envelope over the inferred class frontiers.

``` r
meta_lcm_lp <- sfametafrontier(
  formula    = log(tc/wf) ~ log(y) + log(wl/wf) + log(wk/wf),
  data       = utility,
  S          = -1,          # cost frontier (S = -1)
  groupType  = "sfalcmcross",
  lcmClasses = 2,           # number of latent classes
  metaMethod = "lp"
)
summary(meta_lcm_lp)
```

> **Note:** The `group` argument is not needed when
> `groupType = "sfalcmcross"` — the latent classes are identified
> automatically by the LCM. The `lcmClasses` argument controls the
> number of classes.

## Method 2: LCM + QP Metafrontier

``` r
meta_lcm_qp <- sfametafrontier(
  formula    = log(tc/wf) ~ log(y) + log(wl/wf) + log(wk/wf),
  data       = utility,
  S          = -1,
  groupType  = "sfalcmcross",
  lcmClasses = 2,
  metaMethod = "qp"
)
summary(meta_lcm_qp)
```

## Method 3: LCM + SFA (Huang)

``` r
meta_lcm_huang <- sfametafrontier(
  formula     = log(tc/wf) ~ log(y) + log(wl/wf) + log(wk/wf),
  data        = utility,
  S           = -1,
  groupType   = "sfalcmcross",
  lcmClasses  = 2,
  metaMethod  = "sfa",
  sfaApproach = "huang"
)
summary(meta_lcm_huang)
```

## Method 4: LCM + SFA (O’Donnell)

``` r
meta_lcm_odonnell <- sfametafrontier(
  formula     = log(tc/wf) ~ log(y) + log(wl/wf) + log(wk/wf),
  data        = utility,
  S           = -1,
  groupType   = "sfalcmcross",
  lcmClasses  = 2,
  metaMethod  = "sfa",
  sfaApproach = "ordonnell"
)
summary(meta_lcm_odonnell)
```

## Choosing the Number of Classes

The number of latent classes (`lcmClasses`) should be guided by economic
theory and information criteria. You can compare models with different
numbers of classes:

``` r
meta_lcm_2 <- sfametafrontier(
  formula    = log(tc/wf) ~ log(y) + log(wl/wf) + log(wk/wf),
  data       = utility, S = -1,
  groupType  = "sfalcmcross", lcmClasses = 2, metaMethod = "lp"
)
meta_lcm_3 <- sfametafrontier(
  formula    = log(tc/wf) ~ log(y) + log(wl/wf) + log(wk/wf),
  data       = utility, S = -1,
  groupType  = "sfalcmcross", lcmClasses = 3, metaMethod = "lp"
)
# Compare information criteria
ic(meta_lcm_2)
ic(meta_lcm_3)
```

Prefer the model with the lower AIC/BIC.

## Extracting Efficiencies and Posterior Probabilities

For LCM models,
[`efficiencies()`](https://SulmanOlieko.github.io/metafrontieR/reference/efficiencies.md)
returns extra columns for posterior class membership probabilities,
which can be used for robustness checks or classification:

``` r
eff_lcm <- efficiencies(meta_lcm_lp)
head(eff_lcm)

# Key LCM-specific columns:
# Group_c          — most likely class assignment
# PosteriorProb_c  — posterior probability of assigned class
# PosteriorProb_c1 — posterior probability of Class 1
# PosteriorProb_c2 — posterior probability of Class 2
```

### Class membership summary

``` r
# Proportion assigned to each class and mean posterior probability
with(eff_lcm, table(Group_c)) / nrow(eff_lcm) * 100   # % in each class
```

## Key Difference from `sfacross`

| Feature | `sfacross` | `sfalcmcross` |
|----|----|----|
| Group variable | Required | Not required |
| Group estimation | Separate SFA per group | Pooled LCM simultaneously |
| Output | Group-level SFA summaries | Pooled LCM summary with class-specific parameters |
| Extra efficiency columns | Confidence bounds | Posterior class probabilities |
